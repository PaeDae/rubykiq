# Rubykiq

[Sidekiq](http://mperham.github.com/sidekiq) agnostic enqueuing using Redis.

Sidekiq is a fantastic message processing library which has a simple and stable message format. `Rubykiq` aims to be a portable library to push jobs in to Sidekiq with as little overhead as possible whilst having feature parity on `Sidekiq::Client`'s conventions.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'rubykiq', '~> 0.0.4'
```

```ruby
require 'rubykiq'
```
## Features / Usage Examples

* [Redis](http://redis.io) has support for [alternative drivers](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb#alternate-drivers), Rubykiq is tested with these in mind. (eg `:synchrony`)
* the `:class` parameter can be the Class or a String of the Class (eg push jobs to Sidekiq from anywhere, not just where Sidekiq has the classes loaded)
* The `:at` parameter supports `Time`, `Date` and any `Time.parse`-able strings.
* Pushing multiple and singular jobs has the same interface (simply nest args)
* Slightly less gem dependecies, and by that I mean `Sidekiq::Client` without `Celluloid` (which is already very light!)
* Easier configuration (IMO)

```ruby

# will also detect REDIS_URL, REDIS_PROVIDER and REDISTOGO_URL ENV variables
Rubykiq.url = 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379'

# alternative driver support ( :ruby, :hiredis, :synchrony )
Rubykiq.driver = :synchrony

# defaults to nil
Rubykiq.namespace = 'background'

# uses 'default' queue unless specified
Rubykiq.push(:class => 'Worker', :args => ['foo', 1, :bat => 'bar'])

# args are optionally set to empty
Rubykiq.push(:class => 'Scheduler', :queue => 'scheduler')

# will batch up multiple jobs
Rubykiq.push(:class => 'Worker', :args => [['foo'], ['bar']]) 

# at param can be a 'Time', 'Date' or any 'Time.parse'-able strings
Rubykiq.push(:class => 'DelayedHourMailer', :at => Time.now + 3600)
Rubykiq.push(:class => 'DelayedDayMailer', :at => DateTime.now.next_day)
Rubykiq.push(:class => 'DelayedMailer', :at => '2013-01-01T09:00:00Z')

# alias based sugar
job = { :class => 'Worker' }
Rubykiq << job

# create multiple Rubykiq clients with their own drivers
ruby_client = Rubykiq::Client.new
hiredis_client = Rubykiq::Client.new(:driver => :hiredis)

# create multiple Rubykiq clients with their own namespaces
foo_client = Rubykiq::Client.new(:namespace => 'foo')
bar_client = Rubykiq::Client.new(:namespace => 'bar')

```

## Caveats

* It's advised that using [Sidekiq::Client's push](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/lib/sidekiq/client.rb#L36) method when already a dependency is better in most everyday cases
* If you rely on any [Sidekiq Middleware](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/middleware), Rubykiq is not aware of them so defaults will not be applied to the job hash.
