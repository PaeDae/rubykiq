[Sidekiq] agnostic enqueuing using Redis.

## Usage Examples
Sidekiq is a fantastic message processing library which has a simple and stable message format. Rubykiq aims to be a portable library to push jobs in to Sidekiq with as little overhead as possible Whilst having feature parity on default client conventions.

```ruby
require "rubykiq"

# uses "default" queue unless specified
Rubykiq.push(:class => "Worker", :args => ["foo", 1, :bat => "bar"])

# args are optionally set to empty
Rubykiq.push(:class => "Scheduler", :queue => "scheduler")

# will batch up multiple jobs
Rubykiq.push(:class => "Worker", :args => [["foo"], ["bar"]]) 

# at param can be a "Time", "Date" or any "Time.parse"-able strings
Rubykiq.push(:class => "DelayedHourMailer", :at => Time.now + 3600)
Rubykiq.push(:class => "DelayedDayMailer", :at => DateTime.now.next_day)
Rubykiq.push(:class => "DelayedDayMailer", :at => "2013-01-01T09:00:00Z")

# alias based sugar
job = { :class => "Worker" }
Rubykiq << job
```

##### It's advised that using [Sidekiq::Client's push] method when allready available is going to be better in most everyday cases

## Features

* [Redis][] has support for [alternative drivers](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb#alternate-drivers), Rubykiq is tested with these in mind. ( eg em-synchrony )
* Some minor safety / parsing around the `:at` parameter to support `Time`, `Date` and `String` timestamps
* Simplier setup with less ( gem ) dependencies

[redis]: https://github.com/redis/redis-rb

```ruby
# will also detect REDIS_URL, REDIS_PROVIDER and REDISTOGO_URL ENV variables
Rubykiq.url = "redis://127.0.0.1:6379"

# alternative driver support
Rubykiq.driver = :hiredis

# defaults to nil
Rubykiq.namespace = "background"
```

## Supported Ruby Versions
This library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] the following Ruby
implementations:

* Ruby 1.9.2 (drivers: ruby, hiredis, synchrony)
* Ruby 1.9.3 (drivers: ruby, hiredis, synchrony)
* Ruby 2.0.0 (drivers: ruby, hiredis, synchrony)
* [JRuby][] (drivers: ruby)
* [Rubinius][] (drivers: ruby)
