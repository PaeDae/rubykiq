[Sidekiq] agnostic enqueuing using Redis.

[sidekiq]: http://mperham.github.com/sidekiq/

Sidekiq is a fantastic message processing library which has a simple and stable message format. `Rubykiq` aims to be a portable library to push jobs in to Sidekiq with as little overhead as possible whilst having feature parity on `Sidekiq::Client`'s conventions.

## Features / Usage Examples

* [Redis][] has support for [alternative drivers](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb#alternate-drivers), Rubykiq is tested with these in mind. ( eg :synchrony )
* The `:at` parameter supports `Time`, `Date` and any `Time.parse`-able strings.
* Pushing multiple and singular jobs has the same interface, simply nest args.
* Slightly less gem dependecies, and by that I mean `Sidekiq::Client` without `Celluloid` ( which is already very light! )

[redis]: https://github.com/redis/redis-rb

```ruby
require "rubykiq"

# will also detect REDIS_URL, REDIS_PROVIDER and REDISTOGO_URL ENV variables
Rubykiq.url = "redis://127.0.0.1:6379"

# alternative driver support ( :ruby, :hiredis, :synchrony )
Rubykiq.driver = :synchrony

# defaults to nil
Rubykiq.namespace = "background"

# uses "default" queue unless specified
Rubykiq.push(:class => "Worker", :args => ["foo", 1, :bat => "bar"])

# args are optionally set to empty
Rubykiq.push(:class => "Scheduler", :queue => "scheduler")

# will batch up multiple jobs
Rubykiq.push(:class => "Worker", :args => [["foo"], ["bar"]]) 

# at param can be a "Time", "Date" or any "Time.parse"-able strings
Rubykiq.push(:class => "DelayedHourMailer", :at => Time.now + 3600)
Rubykiq.push(:class => "DelayedDayMailer", :at => DateTime.now.next_day)
Rubykiq.push(:class => "DelayedMailer", :at => "2013-01-01T09:00:00Z")

# alias based sugar
job = { :class => "Worker" }
Rubykiq << job
```
__It's advised that using [Sidekiq::Client's push](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/lib/sidekiq/client.rb#L36) method when already a dependency is better in most everyday cases__
